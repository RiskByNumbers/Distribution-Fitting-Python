# Tutorial Videos Codes and Datasets
Thanks for your interest in RiskByNumbers!

RiskByNumbers provides educational resources around probability, statistics, optimization methods, algorithms, and programming. Outside of Youtube, you can currently find me in Vancouver, Canada at the University of British Columbia. 

This repository is designed to share some of the codes used to create my short coding series, where I show how to implement technical concepts in Python and R in just 60 seconds.
