# Tutorial Videos Codes and Datasets
Thanks for your interest in RiskByNumbers!

RiskByNumbers provides educational resources around probability, statistics, optimization methods, algorithms, and programming. Outside of Youtube, you can currently find me in Vancouver, Canada at the University of British Columbia. 

I have included here the dataset and code used to create the "Distribution Fitting in Python in 60 Seconds" video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKzeyTkX9lg).
